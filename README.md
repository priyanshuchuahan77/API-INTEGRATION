This project demonstrates a responsive webpage that dynamically fetches and displays real-time data from a public API. It fulfills the task of integrating an external data source (API) into a web application using core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
For this implementation, we use the Open-Meteo API, a free and open-source weather service. It provides real-time weather data without the need for authentication, making it ideal for educational and demonstration purposes.
When the webpage loads, it makes an asynchronous API call to fetch the current weather data for a specific geographic location (New Delhi, India in this case). The response includes information such as temperature, weather condition codes, and wind speed, which is then dynamically inserted into the webpage.
The interface is styled using CSS to ensure it is clean, minimal, and fully responsive across devices â€” including mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. Proper error handling is implemented to account for network issues or failed API responses, improving the robustness of the solution.
This project showcases key skills in:
*API consumption using fetch() and async/await in JavaScript
*DOM manipulation to dynamically update content
*Responsive web design using media queries and flexible layout
*Working with JSON data formats
The same architecture can be extended to other public APIs such as news feeds, quotes, cryptocurrency prices, or COVID-19 stats. It forms a strong foundation for building more advanced web apps that rely on live, changing data.
